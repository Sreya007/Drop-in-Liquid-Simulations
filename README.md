Multiphase Fluid Simulation – Drop in Liquid (OpenFOAM)

This project uses OpenFOAM to simulate the behavior of a liquid drop impacting a fluid surface and to analyze surface wave damping across different fluid properties such as water, honey, and oil.
The goal is to understand how viscosity, density, and surface tension influence wave dynamics in multiphase flows.
